# WilkoSuit for Lethal Company

Adds a (slightly scuffed) Wilko themed suit to the game.

This is my Blender debut so I'll probably come back to fix the scuffs over time.

## Installation

Use a mod manager ([r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ebkr/r2modman/) is highly recommended), it will handle everything for you.

If you wish to install this manually, place the `.dll` in you `BepInEx\plugins\moresuits` after installing the above requirements.
